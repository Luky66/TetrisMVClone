# TetrisMVClone
My Tetris MVC clone made in Java was a school project of mine.

I developed it upon my understanding and knowledge of Tetris and put much effort into it.
I also recieved the top mark for my work.

## How to play
At the moment there is no build or anything, just the source code. 
Which means to play you have to download or clone the java project and build it yourself in a compiler.
Then you can start going at it. 

## Is this it?
Yes. I just want to point out that I am not going to update this project at any time. I would like to keep the project as submitted. 
The only thing I might add is an executable.

### Possible Improvements
One of the most requested feature for this project after it's completion was music - the original Tetris music everyone knows.
If not, shame on you! Here you go -> [Tetris music](https://youtu.be/NmCCQxVBfyM)

My teacher that graded this project also said that the blocks are rotating in the wrong direction. I never fixed it. :grimacing:
